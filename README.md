Hello reader,

This project was inspired by my love for anime, but can be used in any regards. The initial aim of this project was to create a full stack website that can update a "list" of some sort. The backend is written in java and uses sql as the database to store the list. in addition, i also wanted to create the front end using material UI, something i was not familliar with but was recommended from a friend, and as this project was not focused on the fornt end i thought it would be a good opportunity to experiment on it, form which i have learnt alot and wish i was introduced to this sooner. 

This project turned out to work really well that me and my colleagues have decided to start creating our own website that will track, store and also act as a forum for anime. Therefore a few additions are not fully functional such as the navbar, however the list itself completely works.

Unfortunately i currently lack the knowledge to deploy the backend and am working on it, however in the meantime you can take a look at the front end and take my word that it works when i boot the database on my own pc. If you wish to see a demonstration dont hesitate to email me using the contact me button at the bottom of my portfolio link!
